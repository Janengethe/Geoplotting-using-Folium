### Understanding Geospatial Data
> Geospatial data is used to describe features and phenomena on the Earth's surface. The three main types of geometric objects used to represent geospatial data are points, lines, and polygons.

1. Points: Points represent zero-dimensional objects and are used to represent discrete locations on the Earth's surface. Examples include cities, landmarks, or addresses.

2. Lines: Lines (also called linestrings) are one-dimensional objects that represent linear features, such as roads, rivers, or paths. Lines are made up of at least two points connected by a straight or curved line segment.

3. Polygons: Polygons are two-dimensional objects used to represent areas or regions on the Earth's surface. They are defined by a series of points that form a closed ring. Examples include country or state boundaries, lakes, or land use areas.

#### Latitude and Longitude Coordinates
* Latitude and longitude are a coordinate system that allows us to identify any location on Earth using a pair of numerical values.

* Latitude: Latitude measures the angle between the equator (0 degrees latitude) and a point on the Earth's surface. It ranges from -90 degrees at the South Pole to 90 degrees at the North Pole. Positive latitudes are in the Northern Hemisphere, while negative latitudes are in the Southern Hemisphere.

* Longitude: Longitude measures the angle between the Prime Meridian (0 degrees longitude) and a point on the Earth's surface. It ranges from -180 degrees to 180 degrees. Positive longitudes are east of the Prime Meridian, while negative longitudes are west of it.

Here's an example of how to represent a location using latitude and longitude:

New York City: Latitude 40.7128, Longitude -74.0060
